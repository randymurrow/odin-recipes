# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/.

## Project Goals

+ Practice basic HTML knowledge
+ Learn to navigate and use Git and GitHub
+ Learn the importance of creating good commit messages (ie, I didn't initially heed the "commit early and often" instruction!)
