        <h2>About this recipe:</h2>
            
            <p>Salted caramels from the <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/moms-caramels-recipe">King Arthur Baking Company</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons (35g) King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>32 tablespoons (454g or 1 pound) unsalted butter, cold</li>
                <li>4 cups (907g) half-and-half</li>
                <li>2 cups (624g) light corn syrup*</li>
                <li>4 cups (794g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 cups (425g) light brown sugar, packed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons table salt</li>
                <li>flaky sea salt, for topping, optional; for salty caramels</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Butter two 8" x 8" or 10 1/2" x 6 1/2" pans. Measure the vanilla into a small container, and set it aside for later.</li>
                <li>Cut the butter into 1" chunks, to help it melt faster. Combine the cut-up butter, half & half, corn syrup, sugars, and salt in a heavy-bottom, 5- to 6-quart saucepan.</li>
                <li>Heat the mixture over medium-low heat until everything has melted, stirring constantly. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.</li>
                <li>Cook slowly, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 248°F, or until a small amount dropped in cold water forms a firm ball. As the mixture boils it will become thicker and thicker and the frothy bubbles will give way to a more blurpy bubble that resembles thick lava. This happens gradually, but you'll notice it around 230°F and higher. This is when you really have to pay attention and watch the temperature carefully, as it tends to move more quickly from 230°F up. The whole process will take about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the heat, and carefully stir in the vanilla; the mixture will bubble and boil.</li>
                <li>Quickly pour the caramel into the prepared pans. Don't add any residue from the pot into the pans; instead, scrape it into a separate container. Baker's treat!</li>
                <li>Wait 30 minutes, then sprinkle with coarse-flake sea salt.</li>
                <li>Cover the candy securely, and refrigerate.</li>
                <li>Remove the candy from the pan by loosening its edges with a knife or offset spatula, and banging the pan on a cutting board until the slab releases from the pan. Allow the candy to warm up a bit if it's hard, or it'll shatter when you bang the pan.</li>
                <li>Cut the caramels into squares, and wrap in waxed paper. Store in the refrigerator for longest shelf life. Wrapped caramels can also be frozen.</li>
            </ol>
